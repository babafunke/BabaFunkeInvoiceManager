# Introduction 
BabaFunkeInvoiceManager is an Azure Functions project that uses a Timer Trigger, Azure Blob Storage and Azure Table Storage to automate the invoice-sending process for my wife on a monthly basis. 

# Build and Test
Clone this git repo to access both projects. The most notable change to perform is:
* Create a local.settings.json file and include the key/value pairs for the configs in the Startup.cs file

# Background
